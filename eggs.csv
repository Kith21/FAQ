In case of usage of your debit card for POS transactions abroad, you are not required to enter the ATM PIN unless the POS terminal specifically prompts for ATM PIN entry."
Will I need to use my PIN at every merchant establishment?,"Effective 1 December 2013, every POS transaction done with your HSBC India Debit Card at a merchant establishment in India will require PIN validation. If the POS terminal does not ask for PIN entry and subsequently the transaction is received by the Bank without ATM PIN, the Bank may decline such transaction since they do not meet the RBI mandate of PIN validation."
How do I shop online using my HSBC India Debit Card?,"Shopping online with HSBC India Debit Card is simple. You will first need to ensure that your debit card is activated.
When you visit a website to make a purchase online or make a bill payment, please check if the website accepts Visa debit cards for online transaction. We request you to visit the terms and conditions towards the usage of the website prior to undertaking any online transaction. Usually this information is given on the home page or the payment page.
To initiate the online transaction, you will be required to enter the following details on the payment page:
Card number
Card expiry date
Amount
CVV2 (the 3-digit number printed on the signature panel at the back of the card)
In addition to the above, some websites may ask you to enter the Cardholder’s name.
Next, you will be required to authenticate the transaction by entering the 6-digit OTP (One Time Password).
Please refer the steps below:
The OTP will be automatically sent by our system to your registered mobile number via SMS, when you complete entry of the card details on the payment page.
The website will open a new window and display a HSBC VbV authentication screen.
At the VbV authentication screen, the transaction details (merchant name, amount, last 4 digits of the card number) will be displayed. Please confirm that the details are accurate.
Please enter the 6-digit OTP sent to your registered mobile number to initiate the authentication process.
The card details and the authentication results will be processed by our system and subject to correct card details and OTP being entered and account having adequate balance, the transaction will be approved.
On transaction approval, the website will display a payment received acknowledgement.
A transaction alert will be sent to your registered mobile number confirming the successful transaction."
Why is there need for a One Time Password (OTP) to complete an online transaction with the HSBC India Debit Card?,The OTP helps to protect against online fraud. It is a secure way to authenticate that the customer making the online transaction is the rightful owner of the card being used.
Will every website require the OTP to be entered for authentication?,"No, you will be asked to enter the OTP only if the website supports Visa debit cards for online transactions and supports the VbV authentication protocol.
Please note that, two factor authentication is compulsory for online transactions originating from websites/internet merchants in India. The authentication is done using the VbV authentication service as explained above.
In case you initiate an online transaction from an Indian website without VbV authentication, the transaction will be eclined."
"I am using my HSBC India Debit Card at an overseas website, do I need to enter the OTP for authentication?","As explained above, if the website supports the VbV authentication protocol, our system will automatically send you the OTP for authentication at the payment page.
However, if the overseas website does not support VbV authentication, the online transaction will be processed based on the card details without requiring the OTP for authentication.
However, please note that not all such transactions will be approved. If the online transaction is prohibited as per Indian regulations or is considered as high risk by HSBC, such transactions will not be approved."
Can I use the same One Time Password (OTP) for multiple transactions?,"No, your One Time Password (OTP) can be used for single transaction only."
What happens if I enter wrong OTP multiple times?,"In case of three successive wrong password attempts, your transaction will be declined."
"If I do not have my mobile phone registered with HSBC India, can I still make an online transaction with my HSBC India Debit Card?","Online transaction requires a One Time Password (OTP) to authenticate your transaction on website which supports VbV authentication protocol. HSBC provides the OTP on your registered mobile number and therefore, absence of a registered mobile number will not allow you to complete the online transaction.
We suggest that you register your mobile number with the Bank so that you are able to receive the OTP for online transaction authentication and also to receive transaction alerts.
You can call the HSBC PhoneBanking numbers for immediate updation of the mobile number subject to successful verifications."
Can the Bank resend the OTP to me due to non-receipt?,"The OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number as soon as the online transaction request is received by the Bank from the website. However, due to network issues there could be a delay in receipt of the OTP via SMS. To factor this, the OTP sent to your registered mobile number is valid for 5 minutes. In the event that you do not receive the OTP in 5 minutes, there will be an option provided in the HSBC VbV authentication screen to generate another OTP, which again would be valid for 5 minutes."
What should I do if I change my mobile phone number?,"As your mobile phone number will be the primary contact for your Bank to send you an OTP or SMS alert, you will need to ensure your new mobile phone number is updated with the Bank at the earliest. Please call PhoneBanking or use Internet Banking to get your mobile number updated on the Banks records."
Can I opt out of the OTP authentication service for online transactions?,"No, the OTP is mandatory for authentication at websites that accept Visa debit cards and support the VbV protocol."
I have a joint account and both accountholders have a HSBC India Debit Card. Can any of the debit cards be used for online transactions?,"Yes, however, please ensure you have updated your mobile number against each of your individual debit card to receive the OTP for completion of VbV authentication during the online transaction."
Is there any limit on the number of online transactions on my debit card?,"There is no limit on the number of online transactions, provided you have adequate balance in your account. Please note that cumulative value of your online transactions in a day cannot exceed the daily purchase limit on your debit card."
Do I have to pay for this service?,"No, you do not need to pay for this service."

With effect from 01 October 2013, fixed deposits will attract a penal rate of 1%, on premature withdrawal, irrespective of the amount placed under the fixed deposit, the date of placement or the date of premature withdrawal.

Why is there a need for a One-Time Password (OTP)/ Securepay password to complete an online transaction with the HSBC credit card?,The OTP helps to protect against online frauds. It is a secure way to authenticate that the customer making the online transaction is the rightful owner of the card being used. Primary cardholders can enter either the OTP received via SMS or the Securepay password for authentication of the online transaction.
Will every website require the OTP/Securepay password to be entered for authentication?,"No, you will be asked to enter the OTP/Securepay password only if the website supports VISA/MasterCard® credit cards for online transactions and supports the Verified by VISA (VBV) or MasterCard® SecureCode (SC) authentication protocol.
Please note that, two factor authentication is compulsory for online transactions originating from websites/IVR merchants in India. The authentication is done using the Verified by VISA or MasterCard® SecureCode authentication service as explained above. In case you initiate an online transaction from an Indian website/Merchant IVR system without Verified by VISA / MasterCard® SecureCode authentication, the transaction will be declined."
"I am using my HSBC credit card at an overseas website, do I need to enter the OTP/Securepay password for authentication?","If the website supports VBV/MasterCard® SecureCode authentication protocol, our system will automatically send you the OTP by way of an SMS for authentication at the payment stage. Alternatively primary cardholders can enter their Securepay password for authentication.
However if the overseas website does not support VBV/MasterCard® SecureCode authentication, the online transaction will be processed basis the card details without requiring the OTP/Securepay password for authentication.
However, please note that not all such transactions will be approved. If the online transaction is prohibited as per regulations in India or is considered as high risk by HSBC, such transactions will not be approved."

Kindly note you will not be able to switch from SMS OTP to Securepay password option or vice versa in an event you have entered wrong OTP or the wrong Securepay password three times successively."
How can I unblock the VBV/MSC in case it gets blocked?,"Primary credit card holders can login to Internet Banking and unblock their VBV/MSC password under the ""Securepay"" tab in case it gets blocked due to three incorrect attempts.

HSBC provides the OTP on your registered mobile number and therefore in the absence of a registered mobile number you will not be able to complete the online transaction. We suggest that you register your mobile number with HSBC so that you are able to receive the OTP by way of an SMS for online transaction authentication in addition to transaction alerts.

By offering you a choice of the authentication service, we make it convenient for you to transact online.

However please note that the IVR OTP you create in Internet Banking is valid for a single transaction within 6 hours, whereas the SMS OTP is valid for a single transaction within 5 minutes."
Can HSBC resend the OTP to me in case of non-receipt?,"The OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number as soon as the online transaction request is received by the bank from the merchant’s website; however due to network issues there could be a delay in receipt of the OTP via SMS. To factor this, the OTP sent to your registered mobile number is valid for 5 minutes.

A chip card, however, contains a microprocessor chip that uses encryption to prevent its contents from being replicated.
The Chip cards from HSBC are classified as ""Chip and PIN"" credit cards. These cards offer the safety of Chip cards and incorporate another layer of security in the form of PIN validation. You will be required to authenticate your purchases at merchant outlets using your 6-digit ATM PIN at the electronic Point of Sale (POS) terminal, in addition to your signing the sales slip, to complete the payment."

This is not inclusive of any interest or principal portion of the ledger balance that is overdue for payment. The limit is reduced on a monthly basis in line with the principal payment expect."
How can I know what is the principal/interest break-up of the EMI paid?,The track record of your SmartLAP will give you the break-up of your monthly interest and principal payment.
How do I repay the loan sooner with SmartLAP from HSBC?,You pay the EMI every month which consists of the interest and principal components. Any excess deposit in the SmartLAP account over and above the EMI helps you to save on interest payments. Such excess deposits will lead to lower interest component in the EMI and thereby higher amount being apportioned towards the principal repayment. This will help you pay off your loan faster.
Are pre-payments allowed on SmartLAP from HSBC?,"Yes, pre-payments are allowed. For this, you must issue written instructions to the Bank stating that you wish to reduce the loan amount."

What are the basic rules to investing?,"Here are some simple guidelines to follow for making wise investments:
Set your objectives.
Make sure you understand exactly what risks are involved with every investment you make.
Do engage with your tax consultant before and during the investment journey to understand the tax implications of your every investment related decision.
Ask yourself whether you wish to invest or speculate.
For investments, make sure that you have an investment return target and the capability to accept losses before investing.
Do not make investment decisions out of panic when the market becomes volatile.
Invest as much as you can afford, but no more.
Always verify the past track record of at least 3-5 years of an investment firm or financial institution before investing in them.
Diversify. Invest internationally and spread your investments over a range of products in order to hedge against losses. However please be aware of associated currency and country risks before investing.
Make sure you understand exactly what risks are involved with every investment you make. If in doubt, seek professional advice.
Keep an eye on your investments continuously. Take opportunities and shift products if it is beneficial to do so."
When should I start planning for the future?,"The sooner you start, the better. The example below shows the difference in accumulative savings between Mr.Early and Mr.Late, who started saving at different times. Mr.Early saves for 10 years and then stops. Mr Late starts 10 years later and saves for 20 years. But Mr.Early still get 87% more than Mr.Late (based upon an investment that gives 10% annual growth, not taking into account annual inflation)."
What should I do before I start investing?,"Before you begin to think about investing your money, you should know your current financial situation and how much you can spare each month or regularly towards making the investments. Naturally, the more you can put aside now, the better it will be for your future. It is up to you to achieve a balance between your current lifestyleand your expectations.
You may use our financial planning tool to find out how much you can invest. Alternatively you can consider the below items before starting to invest.
Calculate your income and expenses taking into account the following:
Monthly household expenses
Mortgage repayments
Personal tax
Short-term loans and overdrafts
Emergency funds
Entertainment
Holidays
School fees
Other family commitments
Generally speaking, whatever spare cash you have after allowing for all your expenses is what you can afford to invest. You must consider to keep aside a certain amount for any immediate exigencies. You can commit to invest a certain amount each month and look upon it as a monthly expense. As your income increases, you should also increase the amount that you invest proportionately. By doing this, you will be keeping up with inflation and your money will be working for you."
"Now that I know how much I have to invest, what should I do?","Once you know how much you can invest, you need to set your objectives - why you are investing and how you are planning to use your investments. Your objectives could incorporate any combination of the following:
Protection for your family
Education for your children
Retirement planning
Managing and growing your wealth
Now make a list of your objectives, in order of priority, because you may not be able to afford to achieve every single goal. Divide your objectives into long, medium and short-term goals. This will help you to choose the type of investment that you need to make. Further you should consider your risk appetite before making any investment decision."
How do I determine my risk appetite?,"Keeping your objectives in mind, determine how much risk you are prepared to take. Do you want to adopt a conservative, moderate investment strategy or an aggressive one? Ask yourself the following questions before you make your decision:
Are you prepared to make long-term investments, which will allow you to take greater risks for higher returns?
If you are going for short-term, high-risk investments, can you afford to lose some of the money that you invest?
If you are married with children, what is the level of risk that you can take and still be certain of their future?
If you want your money to be safe, will you be content with a moderate rate of return?
If you opt for low risk investments, will the returns be enough to cover inflation?
The important thing to remember is that, in general, you can afford to choose higher-risk investment tools for longer-term investments because, even if they go down in the short term, they are likely to show an overall upward trend over a long period. But for short-term investments, you will find low-risk products a more reliable and safer option.
You can make use of our Risk Profiling Questionnaire to help you find out more about your investment risk appetite. Please approach your Relationship Manager for the same."
What is Rupee Cost Averaging?,"Rupee cost averaging is an investment strategy whereby the investor invests a fixed amount in a particular investment on a regular basis regardless of the price. This results in more units of the fund being purchased when the NAV is low and fewer units being purchased when the NAV is high. Eventually, the average cost per unit of the investment product reduce the risk of investing a large amount in a single investment at a time when the NAV is high."
What are the various types of investment /insurance products available in the market?,"Some of the common investment products available in the market are:
Equity Shares
Mutual Funds
Bonds
Investment Linked Insurance Products
Traditional Insurance Products"
What is a Mutual Fund?,A Mutual Fund(MF) is a type of investment where the money of a number of investors is pooled together into a mutual fund scheme and used by the fund manager (referred to as the ‘Asset Management Company’ or the ‘AMC’) to invest in underlying securities in line with the objectives of the mutual fund scheme.
What are the various types of mutual fund schemes?,"Mutual funds schemes can be broadly classified by structure and by asset category. There are specific schemes designed around these parameters, to meet different investment objectives with regard to risk, return and investment horizon. HSBC India distributes various mutual schemes. However, for the product categories such as Liquid/Cash Fund and Close-Ended Debt Funds (Capital Protection Oriented Plans), excluding Fixed Term Funds/Fixed Maturity Plans, the Bank only distributes products from HSBC Mutual Fund (HSBC MF) and does not offer products from other mutual fund houses."
How is investing in MFs different from investing directly into stocks / shares of companies?,"When you invest in mutual funds you do not own the underlying investments (which may be stocks / shares of companies) but have a claim to a number of units in the fund representing the size of your investment. Investing in Mutual Funds allow you to achieve a much wider spread of investments than if you invested directly in the stocks/ shares of companies. It is generally accepted that by spreading your investment you are spreading your risk, therefore investing in mutual funds is generally considered to have lower risk than direct investment."
What are the risks in MFs?,"Before you decide to invest in mutual funds, there are a number of risks (both general and specific) that you must be aware of. Some of these risks are Market Risk, Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk etc. however different funds will have respective risks associated with them. For a full explanation of such risks, you must refer to the scheme documents SAI (Statement of Additional Information), KIM (Key Information Memorandum), SID (Scheme Information Document) and the addendums of the respective scheme. An investment in a mutual fund scheme is not a guaranteed investment. Their unit prices (NAVs) and the income from them, are not fixed. This means that the value of your investment may be less than what was originally invested."
Do all MFs have the same risks?,"No they do not. Some mutual funds have been designed for investors who are cautious, while others for those who are aggressive in their outlook towards risk. There are also funds for investors having a balanced outlook towards risk. You therefore need to understand the level of investment risk that you are willing to take, and then choose a mutual fund scheme, which matches your appetite for risk. The risk rating of mutual funds can change over time. We have mechanisms that can help you to understand your risk appetite, and also the risk rating associated with different funds."
Is there a currency risk associated with investing in MFs?,Currency risk is not associated with all the MF schemes. This risk is associated with only those MFs which can invest in overseas markets.
What are the different fees and charges related to mutual funds? And how do they impact my mutual fund investments?,"Different charges are applicable to different types of mutual fund schemes depending on the investor activity and the type of underlying securities involved. Charges may change from time to time based on revision in regulatory and the internal guidelines of the mutual fund distributor. The main types of charges are mentioned below, however you must refer to the Scheme Information Document of the fund to know the charges applicable to that particular fund.
Initial charges - These expenses are incurred by the AMCs for the scheme(s) before/during the launch towards marketing, publicity, advertising, registrar’s expenses, brokers’/agents’ commission etc. These expenses are not levied separately, but adjusted in the NAV of the fund.
Total Expense Ratio (TER) - These are charges towards the annual management of the scheme, including investment management, marketing, investor communication, registrar’s expenses and other expenses directly attributable to the scheme. These expenses are also adjusted in the NAV of the fund.
Exit Charges/exit loads - Although described as a charge this is really a penalty for early encashment which is applied by the mutual fund. This charge is deducted from the proceeds of the fund being exited by you. Exit charges vary from scheme to scheme and you have to refer scheme specific documents (namely the Statement of Additional Information (SAI)/Key Information Memorandum (KIM)/Scheme Information Document (SID) and addendums) before investing.
Bank Charges – These charges pertain to the wealth management services offered by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, India (HSBC). A tariff card, indicating the Bank Charges for different services/ activities, is available with the HSBC Relationship Manager (RM) and also mentioned on the Letter of Instruction (LOI). Further, the tariff levied by HSBC is displayed on HSBC’s website on www.hsbc.co.in/investments/
www.hsbc.co.in/investments/ Visit the investments section of the website
All the above charges or any other charges as might be applicable are subject to change. Please refer to the Statement of Additional Information (SAI)/Key Information Memorandum (KIM)/Scheme Information Document (SID), addendums of the relevant mutual fund scheme and all the relevant documents such as the tariff card to know the exact details."
What is the effect of these charges?,"The TER and Bank Charges will have the effect of reducing the overall returns you receive either in the income you receive or the capital growth you experience. This TER is deducted from the overall value of the fund irrespective of whether the mutual fund scheme has made a profit or not therefore deduction of the TER can also increase the loss, the mutual fund scheme may have made. Similarly, Bank Charges reduce the overall value of your investment.
The effect of an exit load (where applicable) will be to reduce the actual amount you receive on encashment, which means you will receive less than the market value of the underlying investment. In case of redeeming and re-investing in funds of the same mutual fund company, you need to consider the 'Switch' option which is generally a cost-effective way to transact as there may be no need to pay the applicable exit load to the mutual fund. Furthermore, for a switch transaction within the same asset class of a mutual fund, no mutual fund transaction charges are payable to HSBC India. Investors must read all scheme information documents to know switching charges and exit loads before investing as the same may vary from one scheme to another. Investors much also refer to the bank tariff card to be aware of banking charges for every type of transaction they wish to undertake. The tariff card is available with the RM and is also mentioned on the Letter of Instruction, which is a document to be executed for buying, selling, switching of mutual funds through HSBC . The tariff is also displayed on HSBC’s website on www.hsbc.co.in/investments/
www.hsbc.co.in/investments/ Visit the investments section of the website"
If I invest what am I committing to?,"You are committing to invest at least the minimum amount, which varies across mutual fund schemes. You also commit to understanding the scheme and its associated risks. It implies that you are agreeable to take a degree of investment risk in return for the possible potential of superior returns, in the full knowledge that this outcome is not guaranteed and that it is possible to make a loss on your investment. With regards to close-ended mutual funds, you commit to stay invested in the fund for the complete tenor of the specific scheme. You should also consider how much you wish to commit to any one type of investment, as over exposure in any particular investment is not recommended."
Can I change my mind and redeem my investments at any time?,"No, not always. In the case of close-ended funds, the schemes do not provide a redemption facility until the date of Maturity/Final Redemption date. However, as the units of these schemes may be listed on the stock exchange, investors who wish to exit/redeem before maturity may do so by undertaking a sale transaction through a SEBI registered stock broker. It must be noted that liquidity on exchange may not be readily available. You should also consider the fact that an early redemption may not help you meet your investment objectives. In the case of open-ended funds, you will redeem the funds, however the exit load fee may be levied. A capital gains tax may be applicable, hence you must consult your
tax advisor before redemption. Also, if the price of the units has lowered, then you will experience a capital loss."
How do I keep track of my investments in Mutual Funds?,"The price of mutual fund units or NAV is available through a variety of sources including newspapers, the internet (at www.amfiindia.com
www.amfiindia.com Visit the amfiindia website This link will open in a new window
) and statements received from the AMC. Customers registered for HSBC’s Personal Internet Banking (PIB) can view these details online through a tool called “Wealth Dashboard” at their convenience. Alternatively you can speak to your RM."
What are the tax implications of investing in Mutual Funds?,You should refer to the specific fund documentation for a detailed understanding of the tax consequences of both the fund itself and any effect that it will have on you personally. HSBC India does not offer any tax advice and we recommend that you consult your tax advisor for complete details on how the tax will affect you personally. The tax benefits and implications mentioned in any marketing material provided by the fund house are as per currently applicable tax laws and are subject to change in future.

What is life Insurance?,Life insurance is a concept that aims to provide financial protection to the family members of the insured individual in case of an unfortunate eventuality such as the demise of the insured individual
Why do I need insurance?,"Insurance aims to provide financial protection to an individual, one’s family and assets from unfortunate eventualities such as death, accident, illness, etc. or loss of assets. A classic insurance policy, i.e. a term plan, provides financial assistance to your family in the unfortunate event of your death. In addition to that, modern day insurance policies have evolved to help you to build your corpus of wealth, plan for retirement, protect your house and personal belongings, reimburse medical expenses, hospitals bills, etc."
How do I ascertain or quantify my need for insurance?,"The value of the cover that you opt for should depend on your need for protection. If you are applying for asset insurance, the value should ideally cover the cost of replacing your asset. Similarly, the final payout of a term plan should compensate your family for the financial loss that they will face in case of your demise. Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIP), endowment or whole life policies should fall in line with your overall financial plan and enable you to receive funds when you expect to use them."
What are the different types of life insurance policies available in the market?,"Insurance policies are broadly classified into Life and General insurance products. Life insurance policies provide financial protection against loss of life. General insurance products provide financial protection against non-life events such as medical exigencies, accidents, for homes, travel, automobiles, etc."

Can a minor be the nominee of an insurance policy?,"Yes, a minor can be the nominee of a policy. However, he or she must have a legal guardian in the form of an appointee."
What is a Claim in an insurance policy?,"A claim refers to a formal request to an insurance company asking for a payment based on the terms of the insurance policy. Insurance claims are reviewed by the company for their validity and then paid out to the insured or requesting party (on behalf of the insured) once approved. The payment is made in return for the premiums paid by the insured, however different policies would have terms of payout and the specific details need to be read and understood from the policy related documents or the sales representative before purchasing the policy."
Are there any advantages to buying insurance at an early age?,"Yes. The premium paid on the insurance policy is mainly dependent on the age of the policy holder and the tenure of the policy. The younger the policy holder, the lower is the amount of insurance premium."
What is health insurance?,Health insurance refers to protection against the costs of hospital and medical care or lost income arising from an illness or injury.
How important is it to disclose health status/history in my insurance application form?,"In an insurance application form, you are required to provide various details, including the details of any illnesses that you may have or may have suffered from until the time of completing the application. Such disclosures are very important, as if it is found that your responses in the form have been misleading, you and your nominee could lose the benefits of the policy."
Is my Insurance product guaranteed by HSBC?,"No. HSBC offers insurance products in the capacity of a corporate agent on behalf of the insurance company. The guarantee, if any, under your policy is provided by the insurance company. If your insurance policy offers any guarantees, they would be mentioned in the sales literature or benefit illustration issued by the insurance company."

What is financial crime?,"Fraud and financial crimes are forms of theft. They tend to involve money or property that are gained illegally, and used in a deceptive or illegal manner to gain a benefit from the proceeds. In today's complex economy, financial crimes can take many forms including money laundering, sanctions breaches, fraud, tax evasion, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption."
What is HSBC Safeguard?,"HSBC Safeguard is a series of initiatives to increase the protection we provide our customers against fraud and financial crime across our global systems and processes. It involves strengthening our ability to combat money laundering and the evasion of sanctions, as these are often the driver behind many financial crimes. In addition, we will no longer be offering products such as travellers' cheques, as we believe they are no longer a safe enough way for our customers to convert their money and we may review other products like this over time."
What are Sanctions?,"Sanctions are a policy tool which national governments and organisations such as the United Nations and European Union use to constrain and deter perceived threats to their security, or to conform international conduct to recognised international standards. Sanctions help to stop crimes like terrorism, drug trafficking and arms dealing by imposing restrictions on the business that banks can do with specific people, corporations or countries and the names of these are clearly listed on things like the Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC) sanctions list."
Why is Financial Crime suddenly of concern to the Bank?,"At HSBC, addressing financial crime globally has long been one of our main priorities.
However criminal activity has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years, and fraudsters, money launderers and others have attempted to target global networks like banks.
Improving the way we share and manage customer information will help us fight against the risk of financial crime. After all, it's our duty to ensure that you can bank with us safely, securely, and confidently."
What has financial crime got to do with you or your business?,"As the world becomes more and more connected and information moves around at a greater pace, there are unfortunately greater opportunities for criminals to misuse the financial system. A key defence against money laundering is to prevent accounts being opened in false identities. We also sometimes need to verify where funds are from as part of our ongoing efforts to track our customers' legitimate funds and to protect them from financial crime. Criminals will try to appear to be law abiding citizens or businesses and therefore we need to request documentary evidence from all of our customers in order to fully protect them and their accounts."
What information we're likely to request?,"If you're a personal banking customer, we're likely to need two types of documents from you: one to confirm your identity and one to confirm your current address. These will be two separate documents, however a single document is acceptable in certain scenarios. We'll need copies of the proof documents, which may have to be certified or original sighted depending on the nature of your banking relationship at the time. More detailed information will be available with the bank's touch points.
If you are a business customer, the documents we need will depend on the constituent of the entity i.e. Company, Partnership etc. and the certain nature of your business. Examples of documents that we may need include your company's legal entity structure, list of beneficial owners, identity and address proof of entity / owners / signatories."
How will this information protect you or your business?,"As more and more of our customers live, travel and trade internationally, we're always looking for better ways to help you do the things you want to do safely. Part of this is to protect our customers around the globe. Our global systems and processes work by sharing data and customer information across borders in order to deter and detect financial crime. Even if as a customer you only bank in one country, locally, we have a duty to protect your account as financial crime is a global operation.
By confirming your details and making sure that all the information we hold about you is up-to-date, you can be certain that no one else is able to misuse your account and that in turn we only act on genuine requests from you.
We also request you to update us on any change in the business activity and /or change in the shareholding structure etc. This will ensure that we have up-to-date information in our system and which will help in protecting your account from financial crime"
What we will do with your data?,"The sole purpose of gathering this information is so that our systems and processes can protect both our customers and the bank against financial crime. We take our obligation to protect your data very seriously, so all the information you provide will be subject to the HSBC Group's high data and security standards. The intent is only to use this information for your protection and will NOT be used by any third parties for marketing purposes, unless you have provided specific marketing consent to us."
What you need to do next?,"You don't need to do anything at the moment. In order to manage the process, we'll be contacting customers individually in a phased manner to let them know when they need to update their information. Depending on your contact preferences, look out for an email or a letter in the near future.

What are the basic rules to investing?,"Here are some simple guidelines to follow for making wise investments:
Set your objectives.
Make sure you understand exactly what risks are involved with every investment you make.
Do engage with your tax consultant before and during the investment journey to understand the tax implications of your every investment related decision.
Ask yourself whether you wish to invest or speculate.
For investments, make sure that you have an investment return target and the capability to accept losses before investing.
Do not make investment decisions out of panic when the market becomes volatile.
Invest as much as you can afford, but no more.
Always verify the past track record of at least 3-5 years of an investment firm or financial institution before investing in them.
Diversify. Invest internationally and spread your investments over a range of products in order to hedge against losses. However please be aware of associated currency and country risks before investing.
Make sure you understand exactly what risks are involved with every investment you make. If in doubt, seek professional advice.
Keep an eye on your investments continuously. Take opportunities and shift products if it is beneficial to do so."
When should I start planning for the future?,"The sooner you start, the better. The example below shows the difference in accumulative savings between Mr.Early and Mr.Late, who started saving at different times. Mr.Early saves for 10 years and then stops. Mr Late starts 10 years later and saves for 20 years. But Mr.Early still get 87% more than Mr.Late (based upon an investment that gives 10% annual growth, not taking into account annual inflation)."
What should I do before I start investing?,"Before you begin to think about investing your money, you should know your current financial situation and how much you can spare each month or regularly towards making the investments. Naturally, the more you can put aside now, the better it will be for your future. It is up to you to achieve a balance between your current lifestyleand your expectations.
You may use our financial planning tool to find out how much you can invest. Alternatively you can consider the below items before starting to invest.
Calculate your income and expenses taking into account the following:
Monthly household expenses
Mortgage repayments
Personal tax
Short-term loans and overdrafts
Emergency funds
Entertainment
Holidays
School fees
Other family commitments
Generally speaking, whatever spare cash you have after allowing for all your expenses is what you can afford to invest. You must consider to keep aside a certain amount for any immediate exigencies. You can commit to invest a certain amount each month and look upon it as a monthly expense. As your income increases, you should also increase the amount that you invest proportionately. By doing this, you will be keeping up with inflation and your money will be working for you."
"Now that I know how much I have to invest, what should I do?","Once you know how much you can invest, you need to set your objectives - why you are investing and how you are planning to use your investments. Your objectives could incorporate any combination of the following:
Protection for your family
Education for your children
Retirement planning
Managing and growing your wealth
Now make a list of your objectives, in order of priority, because you may not be able to afford to achieve every single goal. Divide your objectives into long, medium and short-term goals. This will help you to choose the type of investment that you need to make. Further you should consider your risk appetite before making any investment decision."
How do I determine my risk appetite?,"Keeping your objectives in mind, determine how much risk you are prepared to take. Do you want to adopt a conservative, moderate investment strategy or an aggressive one? Ask yourself the following questions before you make your decision:
Are you prepared to make long-term investments, which will allow you to take greater risks for higher returns?
If you are going for short-term, high-risk investments, can you afford to lose some of the money that you invest?
If you are married with children, what is the level of risk that you can take and still be certain of their future?
If you want your money to be safe, will you be content with a moderate rate of return?
If you opt for low risk investments, will the returns be enough to cover inflation?
The important thing to remember is that, in general, you can afford to choose higher-risk investment tools for longer-term investments because, even if they go down in the short term, they are likely to show an overall upward trend over a long period. But for short-term investments, you will find low-risk products a more reliable and safer option.
You can make use of our Risk Profiling Questionnaire to help you find out more about your investment risk appetite. Please approach your Relationship Manager for the same."
What is Rupee Cost Averaging?,"Rupee cost averaging is an investment strategy whereby the investor invests a fixed amount in a particular investment on a regular basis regardless of the price. This results in more units of the fund being purchased when the NAV is low and fewer units being purchased when the NAV is high. Eventually, the average cost per unit of the investment product reduce the risk of investing a large amount in a single investment at a time when the NAV is high."
What are the various types of investment /insurance products available in the market?,"Some of the common investment products available in the market are:
Equity Shares
Mutual Funds
Bonds
Investment Linked Insurance Products
Traditional Insurance Products"
What is a Mutual Fund?,A Mutual Fund(MF) is a type of investment where the money of a number of investors is pooled together into a mutual fund scheme and used by the fund manager (referred to as the ‘Asset Management Company’ or the ‘AMC’) to invest in underlying securities in line with the objectives of the mutual fund scheme.
What are the various types of mutual fund schemes?,"Mutual funds schemes can be broadly classified by structure and by asset category. There are specific schemes designed around these parameters, to meet different investment objectives with regard to risk, return and investment horizon. HSBC India distributes various mutual schemes. However, for the product categories such as Liquid/Cash Fund and Close-Ended Debt Funds (Capital Protection Oriented Plans), excluding Fixed Term Funds/Fixed Maturity Plans, the Bank only distributes products from HSBC Mutual Fund (HSBC MF) and does not offer products from other mutual fund houses."
How is investing in MFs different from investing directly into stocks / shares of companies?,"When you invest in mutual funds you do not own the underlying investments (which may be stocks / shares of companies) but have a claim to a number of units in the fund representing the size of your investment. Investing in Mutual Funds allow you to achieve a much wider spread of investments than if you invested directly in the stocks/ shares of companies. It is generally accepted that by spreading your investment you are spreading your risk, therefore investing in mutual funds is generally considered to have lower risk than direct investment."
What are the risks in MFs?,"Before you decide to invest in mutual funds, there are a number of risks (both general and specific) that you must be aware of. Some of these risks are Market Risk, Credit Risk, Interest Rate Risk etc. however different funds will have respective risks associated with them. For a full explanation of such risks, you must refer to the scheme documents SAI (Statement of Additional Information), KIM (Key Information Memorandum), SID (Scheme Information Document) and the addendums of the respective scheme. An investment in a mutual fund scheme is not a guaranteed investment. Their unit prices (NAVs) and the income from them, are not fixed. This means that the value of your investment may be less than what was originally invested."
Do all MFs have the same risks?,"No they do not. Some mutual funds have been designed for investors who are cautious, while others for those who are aggressive in their outlook towards risk. There are also funds for investors having a balanced outlook towards risk. You therefore need to understand the level of investment risk that you are willing to take, and then choose a mutual fund scheme, which matches your appetite for risk. The risk rating of mutual funds can change over time. We have mechanisms that can help you to understand your risk appetite, and also the risk rating associated with different funds."
Is there a currency risk associated with investing in MFs?,Currency risk is not associated with all the MF schemes. This risk is associated with only those MFs which can invest in overseas markets.
What are the different fees and charges related to mutual funds? And how do they impact my mutual fund investments?,"Different charges are applicable to different types of mutual fund schemes depending on the investor activity and the type of underlying securities involved. Charges may change from time to time based on revision in regulatory and the internal guidelines of the mutual fund distributor. The main types of charges are mentioned below, however you must refer to the Scheme Information Document of the fund to know the charges applicable to that particular fund.
Initial charges - These expenses are incurred by the AMCs for the scheme(s) before/during the launch towards marketing, publicity, advertising, registrar’s expenses, brokers’/agents’ commission etc. These expenses are not levied separately, but adjusted in the NAV of the fund.
Total Expense Ratio (TER) - These are charges towards the annual management of the scheme, including investment management, marketing, investor communication, registrar’s expenses and other expenses directly attributable to the scheme. These expenses are also adjusted in the NAV of the fund.
Exit Charges/exit loads - Although described as a charge this is really a penalty for early encashment which is applied by the mutual fund. This charge is deducted from the proceeds of the fund being exited by you. Exit charges vary from scheme to scheme and you have to refer scheme specific documents (namely the Statement of Additional Information (SAI)/Key Information Memorandum (KIM)/Scheme Information Document (SID) and addendums) before investing.
Bank Charges – These charges pertain to the wealth management services offered by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, India (HSBC). A tariff card, indicating the Bank Charges for different services/ activities, is available with the HSBC Relationship Manager (RM) and also mentioned on the Letter of Instruction (LOI). Further, the tariff levied by HSBC is displayed on HSBC’s website on www.hsbc.co.in/investments/
www.hsbc.co.in/investments/ Visit the investments section of the website
All the above charges or any other charges as might be applicable are subject to change. Please refer to the Statement of Additional Information (SAI)/Key Information Memorandum (KIM)/Scheme Information Document (SID), addendums of the relevant mutual fund scheme and all the relevant documents such as the tariff card to know the exact details."
What is the effect of these charges?,"The TER and Bank Charges will have the effect of reducing the overall returns you receive either in the income you receive or the capital growth you experience. This TER is deducted from the overall value of the fund irrespective of whether the mutual fund scheme has made a profit or not therefore deduction of the TER can also increase the loss, the mutual fund scheme may have made. Similarly, Bank Charges reduce the overall value of your investment.
The effect of an exit load (where applicable) will be to reduce the actual amount you receive on encashment, which means you will receive less than the market value of the underlying investment. In case of redeeming and re-investing in funds of the same mutual fund company, you need to consider the 'Switch' option which is generally a cost-effective way to transact as there may be no need to pay the applicable exit load to the mutual fund. Furthermore, for a switch transaction within the same asset class of a mutual fund, no mutual fund transaction charges are payable to HSBC India. Investors must read all scheme information documents to know switching charges and exit loads before investing as the same may vary from one scheme to another. Investors much also refer to the bank tariff card to be aware of banking charges for every type of transaction they wish to undertake. The tariff card is available with the RM and is also mentioned on the Letter of Instruction, which is a document to be executed for buying, selling, switching of mutual funds through HSBC . The tariff is also displayed on HSBC’s website on www.hsbc.co.in/investments/
www.hsbc.co.in/investments/ Visit the investments section of the website"
If I invest what am I committing to?,"You are committing to invest at least the minimum amount, which varies across mutual fund schemes. You also commit to understanding the scheme and its associated risks. It implies that you are agreeable to take a degree of investment risk in return for the possible potential of superior returns, in the full knowledge that this outcome is not guaranteed and that it is possible to make a loss on your investment. With regards to close-ended mutual funds, you commit to stay invested in the fund for the complete tenor of the specific scheme. You should also consider how much you wish to commit to any one type of investment, as over exposure in any particular investment is not recommended."
Can I change my mind and redeem my investments at any time?,"No, not always. In the case of close-ended funds, the schemes do not provide a redemption facility until the date of Maturity/Final Redemption date. However, as the units of these schemes may be listed on the stock exchange, investors who wish to exit/redeem before maturity may do so by undertaking a sale transaction through a SEBI registered stock broker. It must be noted that liquidity on exchange may not be readily available. You should also consider the fact that an early redemption may not help you meet your investment objectives. In the case of open-ended funds, you will redeem the funds, however the exit load fee may be levied. A capital gains tax may be applicable, hence you must consult your
tax advisor before redemption. Also, if the price of the units has lowered, then you will experience a capital loss."
How do I keep track of my investments in Mutual Funds?,"The price of mutual fund units or NAV is available through a variety of sources including newspapers, the internet (at www.amfiindia.com
www.amfiindia.com Visit the amfiindia website This link will open in a new window
) and statements received from the AMC. Customers registered for HSBC’s Personal Internet Banking (PIB) can view these details online through a tool called “Wealth Dashboard” at their convenience. Alternatively you can speak to your RM."
What are the tax implications of investing in Mutual Funds?,You should refer to the specific fund documentation for a detailed understanding of the tax consequences of both the fund itself and any effect that it will have on you personally. HSBC India does not offer any tax advice and we recommend that you consult your tax advisor for complete details on how the tax will affect you personally.

What is life Insurance?,Life insurance is a concept that aims to provide financial protection to the family members of the insured individual in case of an unfortunate eventuality such as the demise of the insured individual
Why do I need insurance?,"Insurance aims to provide financial protection to an individual, one’s family and assets from unfortunate eventualities such as death, accident, illness, etc. or loss of assets. A classic insurance policy, i.e. a term plan, provides financial assistance to your family in the unfortunate event of your death. In addition to that, modern day insurance policies have evolved to help you to build your corpus of wealth, plan for retirement, protect your house and personal belongings, reimburse medical expenses, hospitals bills, etc."
How do I ascertain or quantify my need for insurance?,"The value of the cover that you opt for should depend on your need for protection. If you are applying for asset insurance, the value should ideally cover the cost of replacing your asset. Similarly, the final payout of a term plan should compensate your family for the financial loss that they will face in case of your demise. Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIP), endowment or whole life policies should fall in line with your overall financial plan and enable you to receive funds when you expect to use them."
What are the different types of life insurance policies available in the market?,"Insurance policies are broadly classified into Life and General insurance products. Life insurance policies provide financial protection against loss of life.

The payment is made in return for the premiums paid by the insured, however different policies would have terms of payout and the specific details need to be read and understood from the policy related documents or the sales representative before purchasing the policy."
